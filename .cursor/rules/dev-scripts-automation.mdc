# Development Scripts Automation

When the user mentions starting or stopping the application, automatically execute the appropriate script.

## Start Commands

When user says any of these:
- "starte die Anwendung"
- "starte das System"
- "starte die Services"
- "start the application"
- "start services"
- "run the app"
- Similar variations

**Action:** Execute `./start-dev.sh` from the project root directory

```bash
cd /Users/louisrossmann/Repo/accounts_automatedtesting
./start-dev.sh
```

## Stop Commands

When user says any of these:
- "stoppe die Anwendung"
- "stoppe das System"
- "stoppe die Services"
- "stop the application"
- "stop services"
- "kill the app"
- Similar variations

**Action:** Execute `./stop-dev.sh` from the project root directory

```bash
cd /Users/louisrossmann/Repo/accounts_automatedtesting
./stop-dev.sh
```

## Important Notes

- Always use the shell scripts, not npm commands directly
- The scripts handle:
  - Frontend (Port 3000)
  - API (Port 4000)
  - Worker process
- No need to ask for confirmation - just execute
- Works from any location (scripts handle cd internally)
